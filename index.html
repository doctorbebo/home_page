                <p class="text-padding">My name is Byron Brown and my friends call me Bebo. Growing up on a small dairy farm in a small town in central PA has taught me the value of a good work ethic and integrity. Though I love my hometown and will probably move back there one day, I had to explore the world. I love technology so the decision to move to Seattle was simple.</p>
                <p class="text-padding" >I grew up always fascinated with video games. I remember watching older cousins of mine playing video games and simply being enthralled. This fascination grew into a desire to replicate the feelings and emotions I experienced. I also grew into a musician where composing music became a hobby. Why not put the two together?</p>    
            </div>
                <P  class="text-padding">I love the Seattle's indie video game culture. That was one of the reasons I moved here in the first place. Through meetups and game jams I have gotten to know the indie culture well and hope to establish an exciting career in audio for video games. Why web development? I want to grow my skills as a programmer, so I can speak game developerâ€™s language. Also, it will provide me a day job that is enjoyable.</P>
